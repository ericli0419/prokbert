# The ProkBERT model family

ProkBERT is an advanced genomic language model specifically designed for microbiome analysis. This repository contains the ProkBERT package and utilities, as well as the LCA tokenizer and modell definitions.

## Introduction
The ProkBERT model family is a transformer-based, encoder-only architecture based on [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert). Built on transfer learning and self-supervised methodologies, ProkBERT models capitalize on the abundant available data, demonstrating adaptability across diverse scenarios. The modelsâ€™ learned representations align with established biological understanding, shedding light on phylogenetic relationships. With the novel Local Context-Aware (LCA) tokenization, the ProkBERT family overcomes the context size limitations of traditional transformer models without sacrificing performance or the information rich local context. In bioinformatics tasks like promoter prediction and phage identification, ProkBERT models excel. For promoter predictions, the best performing model achieved an MCC of 0.74 for E. coli and 0.62 in mixed-species contexts. In phage identification, they all consistently outperformed tools like VirSorter2 and DeepVirFinder, registering an MCC of 0.85. Compact yet powerful, the ProkBERT models are efficient, generalizable, and swift.

## Pretraining the models


### Sequence segmentation and tokenization




## Features
- Local Context-Aware (LCA) tokenization for better genomic sequence understanding.
- Pre-trained models available for immediate use and fine-tuning.
- High performance in various bioinformatics tasks.
- Facilitation of both supervised and unsupervised learning.

## Applications

ProkBERT has been validated in several key genomic tasks, including:
- Accurate bacterial promoter prediction.
- Detailed phage sequence analysis within complex microbiome datasets.

## Getting Started

To get started with ProkBERT, clone the repository and follow the setup instructions in the documentation.

```bash
pip install prokbert
cd prokbert
```

## 4. Quick Start
Our model is easy to use with the [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) package.


To load the model from huggingface:
```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
from prokbert.prokbert_tokenizer import ProkBERTTokenizer

tokenizer = ProkBERTTokenizer(tokenization_params={'kmer' : 6, 'shift' : 1})
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("nerualbioinfo/prokbert-mini-k6s1", trust_remote_code=True)

segment = "TATGTAACATAATGCGACCAATAATCGTAATGAATATGAGAAGTGTGATATTATAACATTTCATGACTACTGCAAGACTAA"
inputs = tokenizer(segment)['input_ids']

tokenizer.batch_encode_plus([segment])

```
